This repository contains the mass spectroscopy data from Arrivault et al 2009 as it relates to the model in Poolman 2000.  For each species, if data is available, it is encoded into three tuples containing the concentration/uncertainty (in nmol g/FW, FW = molar mass) obtained under three different carbon dioxide concentrations.

Caution - the concentrations measured may not reflect the concentration in the stroma/cytoplasm.  From the authors:

"In cases where metabolites are known to be predominantly located in one compartment (Stitt et al., 1980, 1982; Gerhardt et al., 1987), the icon is placed in the respective compartment. Triose phosphates and 3PGA are equilibrated between the plastid and cytosol (see Introduction), the majority of the F6P, G6P, G1P and UDPG is located in the cytosol, where they are involved in sucrose synthesis...The location of SBP, S7P and the pentose phosphates is unknown...it is assumed that they are mainly in the plastid."
