This repository contains the mass spectroscopy data from Arrivault et al 2009 as it relates to the model in Poolman 2000.  For each species, if data is available, it is encoded into three tuples containing the concentration/uncertainty (in nmol g/FW) obtained under three different carbon dioxide concentrations.
